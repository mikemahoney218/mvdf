# mvdf

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mvdf is to provide a standardized approach to using R as a frontend
for the [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3D rendering program.

Please note that this package is in early development; breaking changes can and
will happen as better approaches become evident.

## What's an MVDF anyway?

The `mvdf` package proposes a standard approach to using R as a frontend 
interface for the Blender 3D rendering program. By breaking the development of 
rendering into three distinct steps -- _importing_ data from disparate sources
into a standardized format, _manipulating_ that format through a standard set of
tools, and creating 3D renderings from standardized formats via _exporter_ 
functions -- `mvdf` forms the cornerstone of an easily-extensible framework for
producing data-driven 3D renders.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `mvdf` from GitHub via:

``` r
remotes::install_github("mikemahoney218/mvdf")
```
