The goal of mvdf is to provide a standardized approach to using R as a frontend
for the [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3D rendering program.

Please note that this package is in early development; breaking changes can and
will happen as better approaches become evident. 

## What's an MVDF anyway?

The `mvdf` package proposes a standard approach to using R as a frontend 
interface for the Blender 3D rendering program. By breaking the development of 
rendering into three distinct steps -- _importing_ data from disparate sources
into a standardized format, _manipulating_ that format through a standard set of
tools, and creating 3D renderings from standardized formats via _exporter_ 
functions -- `mvdf` forms the cornerstone of an easily-extensible framework for
producing data-driven 3D renders.

The approach centers around creating special objects from our data that we can 
then create renderings. The simplest of these objects is an `mvdf_obj`, which
just needs an x, y, and z position:

```{r}
library(mvdf)
iris_mvdf <- mvdf_obj(
  data = iris, 
  x = Sepal.Length,
  y = Sepal.Width,
  z = Petal.Length
)
```

With our object successfully created, we can then chain together a few functions
to make a Python script that will render our data when run inside Blender:

```{r}
library(magrittr) # For the %>% pipe

render_script <- 
  # Delete placeholder objects and import standard Python modules
  create_blender_frontmatter() %>%
  # Add cubes at each point in space in our mvdf
  add_mesh_primitive(object = iris_mvdf,
                     primitive = "cube", 
                     size = 0.2) %>% 
  # Save the output to save_render.blend
  add_blender_endmatter(filepath = "save_render.blend") 
```

And we can then execute that script from R using `execute_render`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
execute_render(render_script)
```

This script will produce a Blender file ("save_render.blend") with cubes at 
each point in space specified in our mvdf, with the end result looking something
like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/iris_cubes.jpg")
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of `mvdf` from GitHub via:

``` r
remotes::install_github("mikemahoney218/mvdf")
```

You'll also need to install [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) 
separately. mvdf is tested against the current release of Blender and
is not guaranteed to work with older versions; in particular, some basic 
operations may fail with Blender < 2.80.
